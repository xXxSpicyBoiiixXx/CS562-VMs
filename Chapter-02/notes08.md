# Instruction Set Issues

### Register Architectures 
So if the number of target registers is larger than the source registers than all the target registers can be satisfied simultaneously. But if they are smaller then the target general-purpose registers must be used very carefully. 

### Condition Codes 

These are basically boundary cases, e.g. zeros, negatives, maxiumums, etc. 

The easiest situation is if none of the ISAs use these...
