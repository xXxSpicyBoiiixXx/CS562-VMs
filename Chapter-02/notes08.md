# Instruction Set Issues

### Register Architectures 

So if the number of target registers is larger than the source registers than all the target registers can be satisfied simultaneously. But if they are smaller then the target general-purpose registers must be used very carefully. 

### Condition Codes 

These are basically boundary cases, e.g. zeros, negatives, maxiumums, etc. 

The easiest situation is if none of the ISAs use these... 

During binary translation, the translator can analyze sequences of instruction to determine whether implicity set condition codes will actually be used.

### Data Formats and Arithmetic 

Even though there is some differnce ints and floating points have been mostly standardized. 

### Memory Address Resolution 

### Memory Data Alignment

### Byte Order

### Addressing Architecture 

All of these are mentioend later in detail.
