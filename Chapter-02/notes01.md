# Overview 

Tons of VMs are implementated on the notion of emulation. This means that emulation happes, where the interface and functionality of one system or subsystem is emulated on to a different interface and functionality. 

This chapter is essentially about emulations but on the insturction sets.

With regards to instruction sets, emulation allows a machine implementing one instruction set, the target instruction set, to reproduce the behavior of software compiled to another instruction set, the source instruction set.

Lower overhead for virtual machines is attractive. 

Java bytecode instructions... 

We will operate with user-level instrucitons in the absence of exceptions (traps and interrupts).
