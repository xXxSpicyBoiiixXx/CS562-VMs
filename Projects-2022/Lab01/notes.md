# Project 1: Hawknest 6502v Emulator 

Able to get up to the building ROMs (test codes)

The main issue here is getting the bin/hello file to link with the current makefile. Ask Kyle about this tomororw as well as you're only able to use Intel chips at the moment as docker isn't supported and couldn't get libvirt to work.

Adding our own 6502 emulation but stopped at makefile.
