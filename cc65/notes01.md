# Notes 01

This is for 6502, so we will be writing 6502 assembly while in a high level language like C. 

We will create a 6502 emulator here.  

We will get used to programming in 6502 assembly instruction set.

Cool stuff to note is that Bender from Futurama is coded with 6502 processor for a brain and even the terminator was programmed with 6502. 

So let's look at some 6502 code... 

In 6502 anything with the prefix "$" is considered in hexadecimal while anyhting with a "#" is considered the actual number.
