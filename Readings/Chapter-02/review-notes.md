### Reading 2.1-2.3 

This was basically the difference between different types of interpretation 

The main thing here is to either fetch-decode or threaded interpretations. 

In a fetch-decode we fetch some code and then decoded it while a threaded interpretation is an optimazation measurement where we can have this indirectly or directly. 

With an indirect interpretation we get that code portability but in the cost of performance but with direct interpretation we get beefier code but we get better performance.
