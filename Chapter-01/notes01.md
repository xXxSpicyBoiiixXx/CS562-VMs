# Introduction to Virtual Machines 

As the World Wide Web grew, so did the use of many different types of computers. In the exciting new world where many different computers were being implemetned from their operating systems, programming languages, compilers, etc. There was one restricitve issue here, that the diversity that was in networked computers becomes very restricitive as we can only operate in certain parameters. In today's world, we want to move data pretty freely between on computer to another that may have different underlining systems. 

The underlying assumption is taht the hardware resources of a system are managed by a single operating system. But this isn't always the case.. So we can see the restrictive nature here.. one operating system for one set of hardware resources. Which can be kinda problematic in today's world of networked computers? 

This is where virtualization comes in play. Virtualizing probides a way of relaxing the such restrictions and increase flexibility. Which is everything we exactly want in today's world of computing. When a system is virtualized, its interface and all resources visible through the interface are mapped on the the interface and resources of a real systems actually implementing it.

So let's talk about virtual machines, which this course is about. A virtual machine adds a layer of software to a real machine to support some type other or the same architecture. 

The benefits of having operating systems running is that it can provide isolation and enhanced security wiht multiple layers of OSs on top of one another. This also add isolation from one another so to the user it can look like completely different systems. 

Despite there being differences in this or that operating system, there are some common underlying technoliogies that support them. So we'll see here in a minute.
