The key here is not a translation of the instruction but the execution context for each of these. 

We're mapping register from the source to the taget and mapping the memory image. 

Static Binary Translation is when we don't run the program


Code Discover, applies to loading in code from the fly.

### Dynamic Binary Translation 
-- Start with interpreattion 

-- Bordered by control flow instructions and such 

-- Start with interpreations translation. Instead of translating the code, we can just jump to the native exeution from the translated block. 
-- Code Caching
