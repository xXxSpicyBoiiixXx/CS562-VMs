# Compatibility

The main issue is compatibility, how well does the guest's behavior is emulated on the host platform, compared with its behavior on its native platform. 

Of course, if the processes were identical that would be easy, but compatibility might not be be needed for a process virtual machine. 

Compatibility is a matter of correct functioning, not how fast the function is performed. So we exclude anything with performance when talking about compatibility between source and host. 

Even though performance isn't part of the definition in compatibility, it's a pretty big part. 

### Levels of Compatibility

To have 100% compatibility would be a very strict form of the definition but we can say that VMs that have this qulity is intrinsic compatibility. Another term to describe this is complete transparency.
